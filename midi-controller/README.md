# midi-controller
This project I used an arduino to make a MIDI controller. However since the arduino did not support emulating a MIDI device, I used a MIDI to USB converter. The arduino emulates a MIDI device by using the same baud rate.

### BOM

* 1x Arduino
* 1x MIDI to USB converter
* 7x Push Button Switch
* 4x Potentiometer

### Dependencies

##### Arduino
Open-source electronic prototyping platform enabling users to create interactive electronic objects.

##### Midi to USB converter (SANOXY USB MIDI Cable Converter)
Turn your PC into a music studio by using thsi Sanoxy Midi cable. You can connect an electronic musical instrument to your computer with the USB MIDI cable.
