# mobile-sidescroller
This application began with the purpose to investigate programming in more detail in the Unity game engine. I wanted to create custom UI elements and custom code that allowed me to control the player from those elements, rather than using the prebuilt control scripts. It allows the player to move the character forward, backward, and allows the character to jump.
